    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <br>
    <p >Welcome to the Safe Haven Holocaust Refugee Shelter Museum Virtual Art Gallery! 
        Many of you may not know that Oswego, N.Y. has countless fascinating and unique historical 
        sites that don't get enough attention. Our virtual art gallery brings to light one of these 
        underlooked historical sites by highlighting the narratives of the 982 refugees of World War II, 
        who were allowed into the United States as "guests" of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
        These refugees lived for almost 2 years on the grounds of Fort Ontario, and by navigating the 
        gallery below you can get a brief glimpse into their amazing journies! We would like to give a 
        special thanks to the Safe Haven Holocaust Refugee Shelter Museum, becuase without the work they 
        have done this gallery would not have been possible!
